D3 Demo
=======
This is my first attempt at using D3. Just a simple force-directed graph that shows the cartesian distance between nodes.

The graph plots 10 entities where each is represented by a six-dimensional vector with values from 0 to 100.

You can toggle on or off any of the six dimensions to see how far apart the nodes are with respect to certain dimensions.
